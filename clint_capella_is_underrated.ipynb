He has the 221st highest salary out of the 309 players included.  <b>His salary for the 2017-18 season was only $2,334,520, yet he ranked in the top 15 for PER, WS, and TS%, and he's top 40 in VORP.</b>  In addition, the Houston Rockets had the best record of any team over the course of the season.  It's clear that it was in part due to his contributions.\n",

He's most definitely not a household name, although, he did start to earn some recognition for his performance in the 2018 playoffs. Regardless, you really only need to look at the other names on this list to conclude that he's doing some special work.  Pay the man!"
